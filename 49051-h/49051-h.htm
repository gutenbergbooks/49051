<h2>Life of Stephen H. Branch.</h2>

<p>While pursuing my studies at Andover, I
am corresponding with a girl who resides in
my native city. There were girls in Providence
far more beautiful than her, (and whose
parents were more affluent than hers,) from
whom I could doubtless have selected a companion
for life, but her father had been a boy
with my father, and she loved me as a sister
her brother, or as a fond mother loves her
precious offspring. These truths had their influence
with me. Moreover, this girl had pursued
me for years, and (to illustrate her devotion)
if I went to a ball, she was there. If I
took my position in a cotilion, she would soon
be opposite, and staring me broadly in the face,
and, as we crossed over, she would cast the
most tender glances, and press my hand with
deep affection. If I proposed to dance with
her, her eyes would kindle with the wildest
enthusiasm. If I went to church, she would
be in the next pew, and enter mine, if it were
not full. If I turned a corner, I often would
meet her. If I looked behind, while promenading
Westminster, (the Broadway of Providence,)
she would often be prancing towards
me like an Arabian courser. She would address
letters to herself through the Post
Office, and call for them when I was at the
letter delivery. If I went to a party, she
would contrive to get an invitation, and a day
seldom passed, when I did not see her.
Juliet never loved Romeo more fervently than
she loved me. And because I knew she loved
me as no virgin ever loved, I resolved to have
her. All her kindred favored our union, and
before I went to Andover, her father came, on
summer evenings, to the Post Office, and
conversed with me in the most friendly tones.
So, in the Autumn of 1836, I bade adieu to
Andover, forever, and repaired to Providence,
and married her at her father’s. The
wedding was large and magnificent. My father
obtained me a clerkship in the Rhode Island
Cloth Hall, but manufactures were long depressed,
and its directors resolved to close its
affairs, which deprived me of a situation.
The commercial desolation of 1837 was in
embryo, and merchants were curtailing, and
extensive failures transpired, and clerks and
mechanics were discharged throughout the
country, and my father could obtain no lucrative
employment for me, and dared not establish
me in business in such a frightful panic.
Myself and wife resided at her father’s. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
made several journeys to Boston and New
York for a clerkship, but I could obtain none.
The Spring of 1837 arrived. I was proud
and ambitious. Heartless comments were
made, all over Providence, about my idleness,
and my prolonged residence with the
parents of my wife. I got uneasy, and was
mortified beyond expression and endurance.
I made a final passage to New York, and resolved,
if I obtained no employment, to have
a crisis. I could procure no situation, and
went to Philadelphia, where I was also unsuccessful.
I saw an advertisement for a clerk
in Westchester, Pennsylvania, whither I repaired,
but a clerk had been obtained. My
means were nearly exhausted, and I strove to
sell a diamond ring and gold pencil case to
the barkeeper, and was suspected as a thief,
and arrested, and my trunks examined in the
presence of a large crowd, who came to the
Hotel from every part of the town. I was
honorably acquitted, and instantly left for
Philadelphia, where I sold my ring and pencil
case, and proceeded to New York, where I
sold my watch. I now became desperate,
and resolved to bring matters to an immediate
consummation. I wrote a letter to father,
and told him that I was almost deranged, and
besought him to save me. The banks suspended
specie payment on the day I wrote to
my father, and the whole country was a commercial
ruin. Father wrote me, that he had
spent thousands of dollars for my education,&mdash;had
recently paid my debts in Andover and
Providence, amounting to a thousand dollars,&mdash;had
let me have large sums since my marriage,&mdash;was
not worth over twenty thousand
dollars,&mdash;feared he might soon be compelled
to assign his property, and could obtain no
clerkship for me while the money panic
raged. I proceeded to New Haven, and wrote
to him again, and he responded that he would
see my father-in-law, and pledge himself to
meet him half-way in any proposition he
might make to save me, if he sacrificed his
last dollar. I went to Norwich, and wrote
him again, and he informed me that he had
seen my father-in-law, who declined to aid
me to the extent of a penny, and said that I
must effect my salvation in my own way.
Although my father-in-law was worth several
hundred thousand dollars, he had let me have
but twenty-five dollars before or since my marriage,
and when he placed this amount in my
hand, he sneeringly exclaimed: “I always
like to help the unfortunate.” In view of all
this, I loathed my father-in-law, and loved
my father, and wrote a fearful letter to both,
(superscribing it to the former,) threatening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
to visit Providence, and tear their hearts out
if they did not instantly relieve me. I included
my father in this awful letter, so that
my father-in-law could not be the sole complainant
against me, as I feared he would consign
me to prison for years, if possible. And
I was fortunate in including my beloved father
in my dreadful letter, as the sequel will show.
I then advanced to Scituate, about ten miles
from Providence, and wrote another letter to
my father and father-in-law, threatening to
come to Providence on the following day, and
take their lives, if they did not rescue me
from my horrible dilemma. Two constables,
named Gould and Potter, came to Scituate,
and arrested me at the Hotel of Dr. Battey,
(from which I had dated my letter,) and took
me to Providence in a carriage, and put me in
jail as a debtor, on a debt of five hundred
dollars, created for the occasion by the wisdom
of my father. My father-in-law desired
to imprison me as a criminal, (as I had anticipated,)
but my father’s counsels prevailed,
and I was saved from a felon’s doom. In those
days, debtors were incarcerated, and I was
confined in a dark cell, by locks, and bars, and
bolts, as all Providence feared I would escape,
and kill my father and father-in-law, and perhaps
others. Their fears were supremely
ridiculous, as, if I had seriously contemplated
their death, I would not have
told them where I was in Scituate,
nor the precise period that I should come to
Providence and dispatch them. But my object
was attained. I meant to have a crisis,
and I got it with a vengeance on all sides.
The night I entered my cell was the happiest
of my life. My bed was on the floor, and rats
and bugs crawled over me to their hearts’
content. I never slept more sweetly, though
occasionally aroused by the enormous rats
squealing and nibbling at my nose. The privy
of the prisoners in the large debtors’ apartment
joined my cell, and the stench was almost
intolerable, and yet I soon became accustomed
even to that, and for days I laughed
and danced and sang as never, for I had emerged
from anxiety and torture approximating purgatory
itself. Mr. Parker, a debtor, soon joined
me in my cell, and we played cards, and narrated
our curious experience, and had a merry
time; but Parker obtained his liberty, and I
was again alone, and I soon got melancholy,
and I wept bitterly over the calamities of my
beloved wife, through her penurious and demon
father. In three weeks I was permitted
the freedom of the jail, which imparted perfect
bliss to my disconsolate mind. I reviewed
my classics and mathematics in prison, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
some faithful companions called, and time
again passed merrily. In six weeks my father
came, and (as my only complainant) effected
my discharge, by withdrawing his fictitious
suit for debt against me. He accompanied me
in a carriage to the steamboat, and gave me
money, with his most affectionate blessing,
and I departed for New York, an outcast, in
company with a dear relative named Franklin
Cooley, who had been very kind to me
during my entire confinement, and through
all my days. I left my benefactor in New
York, and departed for Albany, and went to
my Aunt Lucy’s, whom I had not seen for ten
years, who resided in the town of Groveland,
near Geneseo, in Livingston County, in the
State of New York. My grandfather, on the
mother’s side, left Connecticut forty years ago,
in consequence of extreme melancholy, after
his wife’s demise, and buried himself in the
wilderness of Groveland, and wrote to none
of his kindred for twenty years. He first
worked on a farm, and as the country became
more populous, he taught school and realized
enough to buy him a farm from the famous
Mr. Wadsworth, whom he knew in youth in
Connecticut. At the expiration of twenty
years, he wrote to East Hartford, Ct., and his
surviving daughter, Lucy, with her husband,
a drunken and cruel vagabond, went to Groveland,
and in about five years after their arrival,
my grandfather died, and Aunt Lucy and her
husband coaxed him in his closing hours to
leave his farm to them, which was worth
about twenty thousand dollars, one-half of
which should have reverted to my mother’s
children, who were allowed one dollar each,
so that they could not break the will. On
my arrival, I found my aunt’s husband drunk,
and she told me that he had involved the
farm in debt, which was mortgaged for a large
amount, and that he treated her like a brute.
They lived in a one-story hut, consisting of
one room, and a pigeon-house in the roof. I
arrived at midnight, in a stage coach, and as
there was no house within a mile, I was compelled
to stop all night, but where I was to
sleep I could not divine. Aunt Lucy asked me
if I was prepared to retire, and responding yes,
she lit a cheap candle, and led me to the rear
of the hovel, and up she went a ladder, like a
squirrel, and bade me follow. On arriving at
the door of the pigeon-house, she suspended
one leg to enable me to pass her, and then
gave me the candle, and we bade each other
good night, and I crawled in, passing through
dense partitions of cobwebs, and battalions of
spiders and rats, and down I lay for the night,
and counted minutes until the morning’s
dawn, when I emerged from the hideous hole,
in which I had nearly suffocated. I took
breakfast, consisting of pork and herring,
and visited my grandfather’s grave in a distant
field, and departed for Geneseo in the mail
coach, where I examined my grandfather’s
Will, and found that my mother’s children
could never obtain their share of his beautiful
estate. I left for Rochester, and departed for
Albany in a canal boat, and worked a short
time in a printing office at Utica. I left for
New York, and worked a brief period in the
job office of William A. Mercein, and went to
Philadelphia, where I worked a week, and
left for Baltimore, where I found my brother
Albert, who was a compositor in the printing
office of the <i>Baltimore Sun</i>, just started by Mr.
Abel, (an old friend of mine,) whose editor
and subsequent famous Washington correspondent
was Sylvester S. Southworth.  [Mr.
Abel is a native of Warren, Rhode Island, and
established the <i>Philadelphia Ledger</i> after the
<i>Baltimore Sun</i>. In earlier years, Mr. Abel
and myself often worked side by side as compositors
in Providence, Boston, and New
York.] I worked a few days in Baltimore,
and arrived in Washington just prior to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
extra Session of Congress in 1837, and obtained
a situation in the job office of Gales &amp;
Seaton, through the influence of their bookkeeper,
Levi Boots, who was a room-mate of
mine when I worked and boarded with Wm.
Greer, of the <i>Washington Globe</i>, during my
residence in Washington in 1830. I got $10
a week at Gales &amp; Seaton’s, and soon entered
Columbian College, which was located nearly
two miles from Washington, whose worthy
President was Mr. Chapin. I studied nights,
and recited privately with Professors Ruggles
and Chaplin, at daylight, and took breakfast
with the students, and left for Gales &amp; Seaton’s
with bread and cold meat, in a little basket,
for my dinner, and, after working all day,
returned to Columbian College at sunset.
These were the glorious days of the American
Senate, and I was enchanted with Clay, Calhoun,
Webster, Benton, Preston, Crittenden,
Buchanan, and others, whose eloquence and
anathema against the public robbers, were
equal to the philippics of Cicero and Demosthenes
against the scoundrels of their respective
countries. The House of Representatives
was full of duelists, tigers, monkeys, screech-owls,
and wild-cats, who formed a perfect
menagerie. I heard the exciting debate that
led to poor Cilley’s immolation, and attended
his funeral, whose exercises were the most
imposing I ever witnessed. I saw the unearthly
Calhoun in the mournful procession,
as it moved from the Capitol, whose brilliant
eyes reflected the profoundest sorrow. I studiously
avoided my old friend Causin, as I did
not wish to see him after my terrible reversion
of fortune. But we met by chance in
the Rotunda of the Capitol, and when I related
my sad story, he was deeply affected.
We met again, and he seemed quite friendly,
but the charm was broken, and our enthusiastic
friendship soon became a matter of oblivion.
I now receive a letter from William
Augustus White, (dated Burlington, Vt.,) with
whom I was intimate in Andover, while I was
a member of Phillips’ Academy, and while I
studied under private teachers. Young White
wrote me that the Massachusetts Education
Society undertook his education, but it had
failed during the bankruptcy of 1837, and he
was at the College at Burlington, Vt., and
knew not what to do, and solicited funds to
enable him to join me in Washington. I told
his story to the President and Professors and
students of Columbian College, and to Gales &amp;
Seaton, and to Mr. Gronard, the generous foreman
of the job office, and other liberal gentlemen,
who contributed money that I forwarded
to White, and he came to Washington,
where I obtained him a situation with Mr.
Abbott, who had a Classical Academy near the
President’s. White roomed with me at Columbian
College until 1839, when I became
so ill, that I was compelled to relinquish my
studies. My blood rushed fearfully to the
brain, and I was so nervous, that I imagined
if I spoke beyond a whisper, that I would
break a blood vessel. I also thought if I ate
solid food, I would have the cholic as soon as
it entered my belly. Dr. Thomas Sewell, of
Washington, came out to the College, and the
students and professors gathered around my
bed, and I thought I was about to die, when
the Doctor, (after punching my belly rather
roughly,) exclaimed: “Why, Branch, you
are not dangerously ill, and you could not die,
if you wanted to, without suicide. You are
only nervous and dyspeptic, and you remind
me of a nervous person recently described
in an eminent British periodical, who imagined
that he had glass legs, and that, if he attempted
to walk, they would snap like pipe
stems. He made his friends dress him, and
carry him about the house for a long period,
until he nearly wore them out, and they resolved
to do it no longer; and believing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
he could walk as well as they, they determined
to try an experiment. So, they asked him
if he would like to take a ride into the country.
He said he would, if they would put him
in the carriage. They first placed masks,
torches, horns, and Indian apparel in a trunk,
and placed him in the carriage, and off they
drove, arriving in a deep wood before sunset,
and asked him if he would get out, and sit on
the grass. He said he would, if they would
take him out. They carefully took him out,
and seated him on the grass, and then got into
the carriage, saying that they were going
back to London, and that, if he accompanied
them, he must get into the carriage himself,
which he assured them he could not do, without
breaking his glass legs. So, off they drive,
amid his frantic cries to take him with them.
In about two hours, a thunder storm arose,
and four of them, in their frightful disguises,
rapidly approached him, (amid rain, thunder,
and lightning,) all masked and attired like
devils and wild Indians, and made the woods
ring with drums, and horns, and bagpipes.
He sat firmly until they were about to inclose,
and apparently devour him, when he sprang
to his feet, and ran so fleetly on his supposed
glass legs, that they pursued him for half a
mile, and gave up the contest. They then repaired
to their carriage, and although they
drove tolerably fast, yet, when they arrived
at their home in London, they found him sitting
quietly in his easy chair, as though nothing
had transpired, his fancy glass legs having
distanced the fleetest horses.” I had not
laughed for two months, but Dr. Sewell’s
funny and truthful story made all the students,
and President, and professors roar, and I had
to join them against my will. When they all
retired, I arose from my bed, for the first time
in ten days, and dressed and shaved myself,
and raised my voice far beyond a whisper, and
in one hour talked in my usual tone, and called
for some beef steak, of which I ate quite
heartily, and found that my nerves had bamboozled
me most shamefully, and I recovered
rapidly. But I was delicate, and could not
work at the printing business, and my blood
concentrated in the brain, and I had to cease
my severe mental application, and I resolved
to return to my father’s in Providence as the

story, when my father embraced me with his
wonted affection, after an absence of nearly
three years.</p>

<p>This is the seventh week of the <span class="smcap">Alligator</span>,

the courtesy, and kindness, and generosity to
notice my efforts to establish a journal on the

As I have written for the <i>Herald</i>,
<i>Tribune</i>, and <i>Times</i> nearly since their birth,
the premeditated slight of Bennett, Greeley,
and Raymond seems so impolite and unkind
and ungenerous, that I have resolved to analyse
the editorial career of these notorious
big and little villains of the press, who are a
greater curse to the people of this country
than all the thieves who ever entered the City
Hall, or our State or National Capitols. And
next week I will begin their dissection, and
pluck out their livers, and cast them to the
cadaverous and greedy vultures for a choice
repast, which will present the novel spectacle
of thievish crows devouring the livers of their
own species. It is the custom of these editors
to unite and crush those who dare oppose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
them, and expose their crimes, by refusing to
let the wholesale newspaper venders have the
<i>Herald</i>, <i>Tribune</i>, and <i>Times</i>, if they sell the
public journals of their adversaries. If they
strive to deprive me of bread, by intimidating
the wholesale newspaper dealers of Ann,
Nassau, and Beekman streets, so help me God,
I will enter their editorial closets, and lash
them until the blood streams from every pore,
if I am slain in the attempt. Next week, then,
and as long as I can wield a pen, I will show
the people of this country how these editors
blow hot and cold, and black mail, and collude
with thievish politicians, and share their
spoils, and <i>sell the people</i>! And from my
knowledge of Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond
(after a close communion with them for twenty
years,) I brand them as three of the biggest
villains that ever breathed. So, next week,
let the American people prepare for startling
revelations!</p>

<h2>Peter Cooper’s Avarice and Infernal
Antecedents.</h2>

<p>We all know how John Jacob Astor and
Stephen Girard got their first thousand dollars.
And now let us see how Peter Cooper
obtained his first fifteen hundred dollars.
When quite young and penniless, the American
Government owed Peter Cooper’s aunt fifteen
hundred dollars, as pension money, which Peter
long besought his aunt to let him strive to
obtain, and she invested him with the power
to collect it, and he soon obtained it without
much difficulty through some of the vagabond
politicians of those days, for whom he had done
some dirty work in securing their election to
Congress and other civil trusts. On obtaining
the money, Peter requested the parties who
got it for him never to disclose it, and they
promised they would not. After he got it,
Peter would often visit his sick and needy and
aged aunt, and assure her that he had not obtained
it, nor would he ever be able to force
the Government to pay her. One evening a
friend called on Peter’s aunt, (who had been
absent in a foreign land,) and found her very
ill, and in the last stages of poverty, having
sold or pawned nearly all she had. On perceiving
this sad state of her affairs, he exclaimed:
“Why, my good lady, how could
you so rapidly squander the fifteen hundred
dollars, with interest, that Peter Cooper obtained
for you from our Government, as the
pension due you for the patriotic services of
your illustrious kindred?” She slowly raised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
her skeleton form from the bed, and reclining
on her hands and side, she said in a husky and
feeble tone: “My dear nephew, Peter Cooper,
has often told me that my claim is invalid, and
that I can never obtain a cent.” Her friend
then started from his chair, and shook her
hand, and kissed it, and told her to be of good
cheer, and rushed from the house, and was on
his way to Washington in one hour, and soon
returned to New York with a letter from the
President of the United States, (who knew her
husband in his early years,) affectionately assuring
her that her claim was paid to Peter
Cooper, as her accredited agent and nephew.
Great mental excitement and a protracted and
dangerous illness followed these painful disclosures,
during which Peter did not visit her.
After she partially recovered, she instituted a
suit against Peter, which he resisted through
all the Courts for sixteen years, when the
Court of Appeals directed Peter to pay his
aunt four thousand and five hundred dollars.
The instant Peter heard of the Court’s fatal
decision, he mounted a fleet horse and reached
his aunt’s at midnight, and approached her
with these sweet words: “O, my dear aunt,
how do you do? I am so glad to see you. I
declare, how well and young you look for one
so old as you. Well, my dear aunt, I have
come to pay you the money I owe you, which
I have kept all this time, and opposed you for
sixteen years in the Courts, simply because I
feared if I let you have it, somebody would
get it away from you, and you would then be
poor and penniless in your declining years.&mdash;Now,
my dear aunt, I do assure you that I
always intended to let you have the money;
but your memory was so very bad, and you
were always so charitable and easily influenced,
that I thought I could take care of
your money much better than you, and so I
have always kept it against my will, and
solely for your good. And now, dear aunt, I
have written a receipt for you to sign, and if
you will just take this pen, and sign it, you
can have all this money in gold that you see
in my handkerchief, which will keep you comfortable
all your days.” And the poor old infirm
creature tottered to the table, and put on
her spectacles, and signed a receipt with her
skeleton and trembling hand, for two thousand
dollars, in full of all demands against Peter
Cooper, which the unparalleled villain had
thus cunningly written to defraud her of the
balance of two thousand and five hundred dollars,
which the Court of Appeals had directed
him to pay her, after sixteen years of obstinate
and wicked litigation on his part. He then
gave her two thousand dollars, and left her as
a robber darts from a habitation when its tenant
is after him with a dagger or revolver.
She threatened to prosecute him for obtaining
$2,500 through false pretences, and he dared
her to do it. But she descended from patriotic
blood, and was so excited and exasperated at
his wrongs, and disgusted with her species
and modern kindred, and being superannuated
and broken-hearted, and literally worn out,
that, while sitting in her bed dictating a letter
to the President of the United States respecting
the monstrous robberies of Peter Cooper,
she fell back and expired, with her withering
execrations of her nephew on her lips. And
it was the belief of the most eminent jurists
of those days, that her sudden demise saved
Peter Cooper from a residence of ten years in
the dungeons of the State.</p>

<p>Peter Cooper has long bamboozled this city
and country with his bogus philanthropy. He
has not, and never will surrender his right,
nor that of his heirs, to the building bearing
the imposing inscription of “Union” and “To
Science and Art.” He will let the first four
stories, and pocket the rent, but the fifth story
being (like the upper story of the Wall street
buildings,) almost valueless, and which he could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
hardly let at all, he designs devoting to human
learning, by letting it to itinerating lecturers
for as much as he can squeeze out of them, and
put that in his pocket also. And from my
knowledge of his narrow mind, (he having
been my Grammar pupil in his old age,) I do
not believe that he will ever let the fifth story
of his bogus scientific edifice to any lecturer
who differs with his political or religious
views. The penurious old rascal has furnished
the immortal “Union” and “Science” and
“Art” fifth story with the dilapidated and
wormy benches of the old Wash Tub Tabernacle,
and of Dr. Spring’s old brick church,
which were too much decayed for a wholesome
and patriotic or political bonfire. By all
his noise and imposture about devoting his
building to “Union, Science, and Art,” he has
succeeded in prohibiting the construction of
an edifice (on the vacant square at the junction
of the Third and Fourth Avenues) far
more beautiful than his, and by foiling that
project, he greatly enhanced the value of his
own property. And through his stupendous
“Union,” and “Science” and “Art” imposition,
he has cheated the New York Common
Council into voting him a reduction of $8,000
worth of taxes on his building. There never
was such a cunning wretch as Peter Cooper,
whose craft would make the devil himself
blush. Through his pretended love of his
species, and his spurious earnest regard for the
culture of the youth of the present and of
coming generations, he has foisted the merest
old granny that ever existed on the noble Metropolis
as Mayor; and, not content with the
Mayoralty and nearly all of the Executive Departments
in his grasp, this cunning old rat
directs the Mayor (who married his adopted
daughter) to appoint his (Peter’s) own son
Edward as Street Commissioner, which is
worth millions in the hands of such cunning
old thieves as Peter Cooper and Daniel F. Tieman,
who have been stealing the public money
through their enormous speculations and
gigantic suburban operations, ever since they
entered the Common Council in 1828. I have
got the data to write a hundred pages on Peter
Cooper’s indictment, while he had a glue
factory on the old Boston road, and his niggardly
meanness to his nieces and nephews,
and other kindred, and to the poor Irishmen
at present in his glue factory in the vicinity of
New York. He screws down all in his employ
to such low wages, that he barely permits
them to subsist, although their employment
of skinning diseased cows feet and making
glue is the most offensive labor under
Heaven. For his cruelty towards an inoffensive
apple-woman, (whom he seized by the
throat, and dragged from his store, and threw
into the gutter,) he should be horsewhipped
from the Battery to Harlem. And through
his artifice and eternal excuse, (to the poor
starving wretches who have solicited aid since
he began his bogus intellectual edifice,) that
he could not contribute a dollar to any charity
except his building, he has saved thousands
that other equally affluent citizens have contributed
to relieve the sick and hungry and
naked during the several winters of famine
through which we have passed, since Peter
Cooper began the construction of his sham
literary institution. And these reprobates
now strive to starve the sick old fathers and
mothers and grandmothers and dear little
brothers and sisters of the noble newsboys
who sell their papers amid the rain and sleet
and freezing cold, while these leprous and
chronic-pile old scamps are sweetly reposing
in feather beds they stole from the tax-payers,
under the garb of City Reform. Peter Cooper
must soon meet his plundered aunt in the
realms of shadows, whose contemplation makes
him tremble like a murderer going to execution.</p>

<h2>The Early Penury of the Three Napoleons
of the American Press&mdash;Bennett,
Greeley, and Raymond.</h2>

<p>The Hon. John Kelly (now Member of Congress
from the city of New York) told me that
he was the first boy whom James Gordon
Bennett employed, when he issued the first
number of the <i>Herald</i>,&mdash;that he (honest
Johnny Kelly) was then a poor, barefooted
boy, with scarcely means to live,&mdash;that his
duties consisted in sweeping out the office,
running errands, folding and selling the <i>Herald</i>,
and in doing every thing required in and
out of the office,&mdash;that Bennett then had an
office in the basement of a dilapidated building
in Wall street, near William, which was
in constant danger of falling, and for which he
paid no rent,&mdash;that Anderson &amp; Ward then
published the <i>Herald</i>, whose printing office
was in Ann street, in a building subsequently
destroyed by fire, and which occupied the lot
of the present <i>Sunday Atlas</i> edifice,&mdash;that
Anderson &amp; Ward would not let Bennett have
a solitary copy of the <i>Herald</i> until he paid for
it,&mdash;that he (John) used to go every day with
Bennett to Anderson &amp; Ward’s to get the <i>Herald</i>
papers, and that Bennett often had no
money, and would appeal in vain for the
<i>Herald</i>,&mdash;that in tears he often pawned his
watch to Anderson &amp; Ward for the <i>Herald</i>
newspapers,&mdash;that on one occasion, he had no
money, and Anderson &amp; Ward held his watch
as security for the preceding day’s <i>Heralds</i>,
and Ward was drunk, and Anderson was absent,
and Bennett cried so long and hard that
Ward finally let him have the newspapers,&mdash;that
nothing but Ward’s generosity, arising
from his intoxication, saved Bennett on that
critical occasion, as, if Ward had withheld the
papers, and the <i>Herald</i> had not appeared as
usual, it might have ceased to exist, and the
World have never heard of James Gordon
Bennett. And thus one event (even the whim
of a drunkard) often shadows or illuminates
our pathway to ceaseless adversity or prosperity,
or to eternal obscurity or immortality.</p>

<p>The Hon. Horace Greeley was so poor when
he published the <i>New Yorker</i>, that he could
not pay his Wheat Bread Board, and even
failed to pay his Unbolted Wheat, or Graham
Bread Board. I boarded with Mr. and Mrs.
Greeley for seven years at the old Graham
House in Barclay street, and (sometime after
Greeley established the <i>Tribune</i>) Mrs. Greeley
often borrowed money of me, from one shilling
to five dollars. She always paid me, but
often kept it for weeks, which subjected me
to great embarrassment, as I was at the portal
of starvation. But Mrs. Greeley was a
poetess, and very interesting in conversation,
and a sweet and gentle lady, and extremely
beautiful, and her pretty smile emitted the solace
of an angel’s wand, to a cadaverous and
gloomy Grahamite like me, which was of infinite
value to my digestive organs, and I never
could resist her arch persuasion to loan her
money, although it was often my very last
shilling. I know a printer in this city who
caught Greeley in one of Simpson’s Pawn
Boxes. Greeley had just pawned a coat and
silver watch, (which the printer saw dart up
the spout like a Fourth of July rocket,) and
he, Greeley, being near-sighted, was leaning
over the counter, counting the pawn money,
when the printer, being in the next Pawn
Box, (and who had worked as a journeyman
printer by the side of Greeley in a printing
office in Chatham street some years before,)
seized Greeley’s ear, and slapped him on the
back, when Greeley looked up, and blushed
profusely, and trembled from hat to boot, and
picked up his money from the counter, and
walked out of the pawnbroker’s shop, with
gigantic strides, amid the screams of Simpson
and his clerks, and the printer, and all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
miserable wretches present, including the
darkies. Three years afterwards, Simpson
got the boss of the printer to print some auction
placards, and told him that Greeley never
redeemed his coat and watch, which were
sold at a Pawnbroker’s public sale.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Governor Henry J. Raymond,
(soon after he came to New York,) was the
room-mate of my brother Thomas in Beekman
street, nearly opposite Saint George’s
Church, at the boarding house of a superannuated
Presbyterian clergyman named Brown.
Gov. Raymond told me, three weeks since,
that my brother Thomas was the first person
he roomed with in New York. My brother
Tommy had run away from home, and appealed
to me for money, and to get him a
situation. He arrived from Providence in a
snow storm, and as Mrs. Tripler, (with whom
I boarded, opposite Saint George’s Church,)
was full, I got him board at Parson Brown’s,
in a small dark attic room, for two dollars a
week. Two days after he began to board at
Brown’s, young Mr. Raymond came there,
and Brown put him in Tommy’s apartment,
where they roomed and slept together for a
long period. Raymond was very short, but
Tom was much shorter, with the hump of
King Richard on his back, but they slept
soundly, and snugly, and sweetly, and cosily,
and seldom kicked or scratched each other.
After Raymond came into Tom’s bed, (it was
a double, ricketty, second-hand cot,) Brown
reduced Tom’s fare twenty-five cents, which
made his board one dollar and seventy-five
cents a week, and even that was quite a tax
on my attenuated purse. Tom has often told
me that he and Raymond would sometimes
talk on religion and politics until the doleful
hours of midnight, and related many funny
anecdotes of Raymond, which I shall publish
in the “History of my Life.” Tom said that
Raymond was so poor at this time, that he
could hardly subsist, and used to have his hair
cut close to the skull, to save barber’s money,
and wash his handkerchiefs and stockings,
and sometimes his shirts, and used to mend
his shirts and stockings every Sunday morning,
and the room was so cold, that Raymond
sat up in the cot, with his legs covered with
the sheet and blanket, while he darned his
stockings and sewed the rips of his shirts, and
that he, (Tom,) suffered severely while Raymond
was sitting up in the cot mending his
duds, letting in the cold air on his (Tom’s)
back and legs. Poor Tommy is cold now,
(dying from the rheumatism and dropsy that
Raymond gave him,) and I recently bore his
tiny body, and big heart, and intelligent brain
to our family tomb in Rhode Island, by whose
side I may soon repose.</p>

<p>Bennett, Greeley, and Raymond are now
at the summit of the American Press, and we
shall soon show that they have not been true
to the children of the Great Being who raised
them from utter penury and obscurity to their
present exalted position. And we shall review
the source and rise of their Secretaries,
Hudson, Dana, and Tuthill, on some very fine
day, and then we shall analyse our own mysterious
career, and then&mdash;&mdash;O me! O glass!
O paint! O putty! O Cooper! O Tiemann!
O Edward! O Jeremiah! and the Italian
Tasso!</p>
